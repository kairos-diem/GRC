The CIS Critical Security Controls provides a highly practical and useful framework for every organization to use for both implementation and assessment. Because the Controls are developed by the community and based on actual threat data, they are an authoritative, industry-friendly, and vendor-neutral approach to assessment and auditing of security. 
CIS Controls Version 8 combines and consolidates the CIS Controls by activities. I have provided each category with the necessary questions to easily adapt it to your company’s need. Further information and ways to implement them are given in the links below.   

CIS Control 1: Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;   →Do we know what is connected to our systems and networks?<br />
CIS Control 2: Inventory and Control of Software Assets<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  →Do we know what software is running (or trying to run) on our systems and networks?<br />
CIS Control 3: Data Protection<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  →Do we have standardized process to develop and technical controls in place to identify, classify, securely handle, retain, and dispose of data? <br />
CIS Control 4: Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; →Are we continuously managing our systems using “known good” configurations?<br />
CIS Control 5: Account Management<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  →Do we track the people who have the administrative privileges to change, bypass, or over-ride our security settings?<br />
CIS Control 6: Access Control Management<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; →Do we limit the access credentials and privileges for users, administrative and service accounts for the enterprise software and assets?<br />
CIS Control 7: Continuous Vulnerability Management<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; →Are we continuously looking for and managing “known bad” software?<br />
CIS Control 8: Audit Log Management<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  →Do we have proper logging in place for alerts, reviews and events for auditing, detecting, understanding and recovering from attacks?<br />
CIS Control 9: Email and Web Browser Protections<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  →Do we have training and detection for phishing through email and web vectors ?<br />
CIS Control 10: Malware Defenses<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; →Do we have proper containment and network segmentation to prevent spread and execution of malicious applications?<br />
CIS Control 11: Data Recovery<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  →Are proper data recovery practices in place to restore assets to pre-incident and trusted state?<br />
CIS Control 12: Network Infrastructure Management<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  →Are we keeping track of the legacy network devices in order to prevent attackers from exploiting these access points?<br />
CIS Control 13: Network Monitoring and Defense<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  →Have we implemented the necessary procedures and tooling to monitor and defend against security threats?<br />
CIS Control 14: Security Awareness and Skills Training<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  →Are we implementing proper annual, in time & technology infused security awareness and training?<br />
CIS Control 15: Service Provider Management<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  →Are we reviewing the sensitive data and mission critical IT platforms or processes held by the service providers?<br />
CIS Control 16: Application Software Security<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  →Are secure software development life cycle for applications being implemented?<br />
CIS Control 17: Incident Response Management<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; →Is a program in place to develop and maintain an incident response capability?<br />
CIS Control 18: Penetration Testing<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; →Do we have regular third party assessments of security posture of the company assets and simulations of attackers exploiting weaknesses?<br />

The key benefit of the CIS Controls is that they prioritize and focus a smaller number of actions with a high pay-off, aiming for a “must do first” philosophy. Further, the Controls are derived from the most common attack patterns highlighted in the leading threat reports and vetted across a broad community of government and industry practitioners. As a result of the strong consensus upon which they are based, the Controls serve as the basis for immediate high-value action.
